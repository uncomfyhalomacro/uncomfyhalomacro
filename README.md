### About Me

Hello there,

I am **Soc Virnyl Estela**, also known by the tech community _uncomfy_ or _uncomfyhalomacro_.

I've been a self-taught developer since 2019. It started with a very slow laptop
that I needed to finish my thesis. So my solution to that was to install Debian
Linux and everything changed.

I finished my undergraduate in Biology (Major in Microbiology) in 2022 and
worked as a college instructor until 2024. During those years, I self-learned
and contributed to the [openSUSE Community](https://opensuse.org) as a packager
and open-source developer.

Luckily, I was able to shift my career to tech as a technical writer since 2024
until 2025. I then worked as an early career software developer for 4 months where I built
projects in Rust, Golang and Python.
